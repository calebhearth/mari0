## About Mari0

Two genre defining games from completely different eras: Nintendo's Super Mario
Bros. and Valve's Portal. These two games managed to give Platformers and
First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. But what if
Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal
gun mechanics?

A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on 
perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give Mario a portal
gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. And if that
wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with everyone having their own Portal
gun!

## Features

 - Complete recreation of SMB
 - Elements from Portal
 - Portal gun that shoots portals
 - 4-player simultaneous coop
 - Level Editor that was used to create the levels in the game
 - 33 different hats
 - Downloadable Mappacks
 - Game modifiers for extra fun
